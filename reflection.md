I consulted with Mackenzie Martin while working on this assignment. We met mainly to discuss how to resolve issues in our respective code. Both of us felt adept at resolving bugs but it was immensely helpful to discuss why our code was functional but not doing what we wanted it to. I did not, however, attend any TA/office hours this week.

I'm emjoying Java! I felt VERY lost when I started working through the warmups for this assignment but now feel much more comfortable. The switch in how concepts are initialized has been a little tricky to get the hang of but I feel confident in my ability to both consult the documentation and generally find resources by googling. 

I've noticed that general concepts (strings, integers, if statements, for/which loops) have remained similar across the two languages, which makes me think these basic building blocks are relatively similar across programming in general. 

My advice to someone taking this course in the future is to do the assignment warmup and figure out what's going on with each thing! It was a gentle introduction into Java that built nicely on my understanding of Python. What worked: starting with a LOT of code (I had a MASSIVE if-else if statement for most of the time I was working on this assignment and only about half an hour ago managed to turn that into the single if statement using two for loops in the interpretPhrase method) before reducing it. What did not work: arrays more complicated than what I've got here. Arrays vs lists are not jiving with me. I am confused.

Resubmit change: 
The goal of what I did that caused the infinite loop was to prevent the program from throwing exceptions and stopping if the user put in something that wasn't an integer when deciding how many rounds to converse for. I used a while loop and forgot to have a "break" in there to move out of the loop. 

I also fixed an error on line 67 that caused the printed transcript to incorrectly store the responses if the program modified the input for the response.
